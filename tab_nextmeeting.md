### Session

Introduction to OWASP Mumbai Chapter.

Enforcing Code & Security Standards with Semgrep **Luke O'Malley**

General Discussion, QnA & Feedback

**Abstract:**
Semgrep is a free open-source program analysis toolkit that finds bugs using custom analysis weâ€™ve written and OSS code checks.
Semgrep is ideal for security researchers, product security engineers, and developers who want to find complex code patterns without extensive knowledge of ASTs or advanced program analysis concepts.
