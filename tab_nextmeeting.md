Session Details:

Introduction to OWASP Mumbai Chapter.

Field Updates with **Anantkumar Joshi**.

The Dark Arts of SSH by **Karan**.
An exploration of port forwarding, tunneling, pivoting behind enemy lines, and seamless Data Exfiltration.
Description : 
This talk will focus on the art of living off the land. A technique in which an attacker leverages existing tools on a system to further gain access, persistence without triggering alarms. 
SSH is a tool that is used by almost every sysadmin, developer and just about every tech in between. A lot of you may know about  port forwarding, and reverse / forward tunneling, however we will stretch the boundaries of these use cases to explore a bullet-proof C2 style architecture for lateral movement and data exfiltration behind a corporate network. We will also describe practical use cases of this scenario to make penetration tests more efficient using 'drop boxes' as jump servers inside corporate networks. This session will have live demonstrations on virtualised architecture that will be representative of exact real-life scenarios.
